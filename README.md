*Issue Statement*
Current air quality data is coarse & infrequent, preventing identification of disparities and creation of targeted interventions
City agencies & civil society service providers will already be doing analysis to interpret & interpolate the available data

*Proposed Solution*
Our solution benefits these audiences in the following ways:
- The citizens of NYC: An engaging & low cost way air quality measurements
- City agencies, civil society organizations & other service providers: An opportunity to enforce current policies & laws, create & inform future policies and more effectively target supporting services
